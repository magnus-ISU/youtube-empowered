## Motivation:
The 'Enhancer for Youtube' extension is very useful and powerful, which is why it is all the more tragic that it is proprietary. So, I want to implement all the features (that I think are useful) from that extension in libre code.

List of features:
 - Videos start in theater mode by default
 - Videos in Theater mode take up the entire viewport
 - Scrolling down beyond the video playback area shows a mini player that follows you

List of planned features from Enhancer:
 - Prevent autoplay on videos in the background

List of planned features not from Enhancer:
 - Keyboard navigation for comments, like RES
 - Have a way to show only comments below a video, only the description, or only recommendations; like NewPipe

List of features that will not be added:
 - Ad-blocker: Use uBlock Origin
 - Speed controls: Use Video Speed Controller
 - Theming: Install Stylus
 - Cinema Mode: Use a dark theme
